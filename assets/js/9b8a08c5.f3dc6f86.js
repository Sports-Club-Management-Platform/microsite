We were also unable to do the daily stand-ups; instead, we organized two short weekly meetings to discuss each team member\'s progress.\\n\\n## Sprint Burndown Chart\\n\\n![Burndown Chart](../../static/img/sprints/burndown_chart_sprint_3.png)"},{"id":"Sprint 2","metadata":{"permalink":"/microsite/blog/Sprint 2","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-28-sprint_2/sprint_2.md","title":"Sprint 2","description":"From: 2024-10-14","date":"2024-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.615,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Hugo Correia","url":"https://github.com/MrLoydHD","imageURL":"https://github.com/MrLoydHD.png","key":"hugo","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Sprint 2","title":"Sprint 2","authors":["hugo"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Sprint 3","permalink":"/microsite/blog/Sprint 3"},"nextItem":{"title":"Sprint 1","permalink":"/microsite/blog/Sprint 1"}},"content":"**From**: 2024-10-14\\n\\n**To**: 2024-10-28\\n\\n**Scrum Master**: Hugo Correia\\n\\n**Product Owner**: Andr\xe9 Oliveira\\n\\n**Developers**: Joaquim Rosa, Miguel Belchior, Andr\xe9 Oliveira\\n\\n## Sprint Goal\\n\\nIn order to complete the second milestone of our project, it is expectable to conclude the following sprints goals:\\n\\n- Implement the first version of the Matches Page\\n- Update the Landing Page with the next match\\n- Implement the Games API\\n- Populate the Games DB\\n- Link the Backend with the Frontend\\n- Implement the Games API -
