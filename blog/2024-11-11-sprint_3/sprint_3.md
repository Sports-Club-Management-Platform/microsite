## Sprint Retrospective

In this sprint, we were unable to complete any of the tasks due to a lack of time to invest in the project. We were working on other projects, and none of the team members could dedicate much time to this project. We tried to do the terraform for deploying the project, but we were unable to complete it. We were also unable to do the daily stand-ups; instead, we organized two short weekly meetings to discuss each team member's progress.
