During the development of our application we spread the work to be done by sprints. Each sprint had a duration of 2 weeks (except the first one) and at the end of each sprint we had a meeting to discuss the work done and the work to be done in the next sprint.

The distribution made is listed below:

| Sprint | Scrum Master | Product Owner | Developers |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| 1 | Alexandre Cotorobai | Miguel Belchior | Hugo Correia, Joaquim Rosa, Andr√© Oliveira |
