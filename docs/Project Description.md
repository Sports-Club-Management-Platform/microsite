# Project Description

## Brief Overview of the Project

Sportify offers an efficient and user-friendly system for managing ticket sales and member subscriptions, ensuring a smooth and streamlined experience for both fans and staff. Fans can easily purchase tickets through an intuitive platform and access games hassle-free by scanning QR codes at the entrance, which simplifies entry procedures. The staff uses QR code validation to ensure secure and efficient access, enhancing the overall fan experience.

Additionally, the system allows users to manage their club memberships effortlessly. Fans can subscribe, renew, or manage their membership plans, while the platform provides seamless integration with event updates, ensuring users stay informed about upcoming games, schedule changes, and other important announcements. With personalized notifications via email or SMS, fans are always in the loop, improving engagement.

### Key Features

- **Membership Management**: Fans can subscribe to or manage their club memberships directly through the platform.
