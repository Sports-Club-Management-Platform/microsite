## Description

A user story is considered ready for work once it meets all the criteria specified in the definition of ready (DoR). This indicates that the user story is fully prepared for the team to begin its implementation. Following these criteria guarantees that user stories are well-defined and ready for team engagement, which improves the development processâ€™s efficiency and effectiveness and results in the delivery of higher-quality software.

## Our Definition

- **Independent User Story:** The user story does not depend on another User Story(ies) to be implemented.
- **Clear acceptance criteria:** written in the [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/).
- **Mockups/Designs:** The user story has mockups or designs that help the team understand the requirements.
- **Defined Requirements**: The requirements are well defined and are clearly understood by the development team.
- **Effort/cost estimated:** The user story has been estimated by the team (in story points).

## Story Points Estimation

Story points are a way to estimate the amount of effort required to complete a user story in our product backlog.
So, to better organize the work to be done, before the start of each sprint we evaluate our stories and their estimated effort.

| How much is known about the task | Dependencies    | How much work effort | Story points | Example                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | --------------------    |
| Everything                       | None            | Less than 3 hours    | 1            | Building a Landing Page |
| Almost everything                | Almost none     | Half a day           | 2            |                         |
| Something                        | Some            | Up to 2 days         | 3            |                         |
| Almost nothing                   | Few             | Few days             | 5            |                         |
| Nothing                          | More than a few | Around a week        | 8            |                         |
