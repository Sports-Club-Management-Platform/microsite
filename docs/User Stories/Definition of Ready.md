## Description

A user story is considered ready for work once it meets all the criteria specified in the definition of ready (DoR). This indicates that the user story is fully prepared for the team to begin its implementation. Following these criteria guarantees that user stories are well-defined and ready for team engagement, which improves the development processâ€™s efficiency and effectiveness and results in the delivery of higher-quality software.

## Our Definition

- **Well-defined history:** The user story is independent and written clearly and concisely, with specific acceptance criteria.
- **Clear acceptance criteria:** The team has a clear understanding of the requirements and what needs to be done.
- **Resolved dependencies:** All dependencies or blockers have been identified and resolved.
- **Effort estimated:** The user story has been estimated by the team (in story points or another metric).

## Story Points Estimation

Story points are a way to estimate the amount of effort required to complete a user story in our product backlog.
So, to better organize the work to be done, before the start of each sprint we evaluated our stories.

| How much is known about the task | Dependencies    | How much work effort | Story points |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| Everything                       | None            | Less than 2 hours    | 1            |
| Almost everything                | Almost none     | Half a day           | 2            |
| Something                        | Some            | Up to 2 days         | 3            |
| Almost nothing                   | Few             | Few days             | 5            |
| Nothing                          | More than a few | Around a week        | 8            |
| Nothing                          | Unknown         | More than one week   | 13           |
