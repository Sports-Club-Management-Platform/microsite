## Description

In agile software development, the “Definition of Done” (DoD) is an essential set of criteria that must be fulfilled before a product increment, such as a user story or feature, can be regarded as complete and ready for release. This definition instills confidence in the team regarding the delivery of high-quality software. Initially, our team collaboratively established the specific criteria and parameters that make up our DoD.

## Our Definition

- **Developed:** The functionality expected of the story has been fully developed.
- **Tested:** Successfully passes the implemented tests without errors.
- **Documented:** Ensure that the functionality is well-documented, including:
  - Well-commented code
  - Technical documentation
- **Acceptance Criteria Met:** Ensure that all acceptance criteria specified in the user story are satisfied.
- **Quality Gate Clearance:** Verify that the product increment meets all predefined quality standards and pass the quality gate.
- **Peer Review:** PR reviewed and approved by a different team member.
