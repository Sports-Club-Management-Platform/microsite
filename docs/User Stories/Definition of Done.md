## Description

In agile software development, the “Definition of Done” (DoD) is an essential set of criteria that must be fulfilled before a product increment, such as a user story or feature, can be regarded as complete and ready for release. This definition instills confidence in the team regarding the delivery of high-quality software. Initially, our team collaboratively established the specific criteria and parameters that make up our DoD.

## Our Definition

- **Acceptance Criteria Met:** Ensure that all acceptance criteria specified in the user story are satisfied.
- **Feature Implementation:** Confirm that the functionality has been fully developed and is operational.
- **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing, including unit tests and integration tests, ensuring the functionality passes all tests without errors.
- **Quality Gate Clearance:** Verify that the product increment meets all predefined quality standards and passes the quality gate.
- **Peer Review:** Submit the pull request (PR) for review and ensure it is approved by a different team member.
- **Documentation::** Ensure that the functionality is well-documented, including:
  - Well-commented code
  - Technical documentation
  - User manual, if applicable
